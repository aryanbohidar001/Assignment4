# Assignment4

This repository contains solutions to two fundamental file handling tasks using Python:

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- The program reads content from a specified text file.
- It demonstrates robust error handling to manage scenarios such as missing files or read permission issues.
- Appropriate user-friendly error messages are displayed.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- The program writes data to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.
- It also demonstrates how to append new data to an existing file without overwriting its contents.
